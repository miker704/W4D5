Benchmarking(bonus problems)
Ruby includes a Benchmark module in the standard library to test the execution time of code. 
This can be very useful if you need to approximate the real-world performance of different 
algorithms to determine which one is best for your particular application.

Go back through the day's solutions and use Benchmark to verify the Big-O performance
 of your various solutions. You can find the docs here, and there's an example of how 
 to use it in the sorting complexity demo from the Sorting Complexity reading.
