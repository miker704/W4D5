# my_min
# Given a list of integers find the smallest number in the list.

# Example:

    list = [ 0, 3, 5, 4, -5, 10, 1, 90 ]
    my_min(list)  # =>  -5
# Phase I
# First, write a function that compares each element 
# to every other element of the list. Return the element if 
# all other elements in the array are larger.
# What is the time complexity for this function?

# Phase II
# Now rewrite the function to iterate through the 
# list just once while keeping track of the minimum. 
# What is the time complexity?
